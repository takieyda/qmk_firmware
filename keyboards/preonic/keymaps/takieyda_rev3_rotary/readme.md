# Takieyda's Preonic Rev 3 Layout

More to come.

## Description
A layout that takes the default Planck/Preonic layout and adds a little bit from the Pok3r. I had to make some changes to my normal files for compatibility with the Rev 6 board for some reason. Semper tinker!

## Flashing Instructions
 Because I keep forgetting the command line commands to compile and flash the firmware I've decided to include it here.
